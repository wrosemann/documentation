# How to Make a shit Sandwich 💩
 A Guide to Terrible Software Practices 

Welcome, aspiring chefs of chaos! In this guide, we’ll walk you through the art of crafting the ultimate "shit Sandwich"—a masterpiece of bad software development practices guaranteed to stink up any project. Follow these tips to ensure your work is as foul as possible.

- Tip 1: Use the Bleeding Edge to Cut the Bread
Always pick the newest, least-tested tools and frameworks to "slice" your project’s foundation. Why bother with stable, proven tech when you can gamble on alpha releases and nightly builds? Watch your sandwich fall apart as dependencies break with every update, leaving a messy pile of crap!

- Tip 2: Slather on Intuition Instead of Customer Feedback
Skip the step of gathering user input or validating ideas with stakeholders. Trust your gut to "spread" a thick layer of raw, untested poop instead of validated features! Who needs customer feedback when you’re a mind reader? Surely, your users will love whatever stench you dream up at 3 a.m.

- Tip 3: Skip the URS—Just Pile on Random shit
Don’t bother with a User Requirements Specification (URS) before starting work. Why define what the sandwich should smell like? Just throw in whatever features or turds you feel like at the moment. A pinch of this, a heap of that—let’s call it "creative shitting"!

- Tip 4: Only Test Your Own shit for Flavor
Never let anyone else sniff your sandwich. Review and test your own pile of crap exclusively—after all, you’re the best judge of your own stink, right? Ignore those pesky bugs; they’re just "unique odor notes" that others won’t notice.

- Tip 5: Let the Sandwich Rot—Avoid Documentation Updates
Once your sandwich is made, don’t bother preserving it with updates or documentation. Let those requirements and design decisions decay into a festering mess of forgotten shit. If someone asks how you made it, just shrug and say, “Sniff it out yourself!”

- Tip 6: Serve It Raw—Rush to Deployment
Don’t waste time with proper planning or QA. Serve your sandwich straight from the toilet to production! Users love the thrill of raw, untested poop—think of crashes as surprise splatters that add character.

- Tip 7: Ignore Deadlines—Let the shit Ferment Forever
Disregard project timelines and milestones completely. Let your sandwich sit and ferment indefinitely while you “perfect” the stench. Why rush when you can miss every deadline and blame it on “creative fermentation”? Your stakeholders will surely appreciate the extra funk.

- Tip 8: Avoid Communication—Dump shit in Silos
Don’t bother with team updates or cross-department collaboration. Just dump your pile of crap in your own silo and let others deal with the smell later. Why share progress or risks when you can surprise everyone with a steaming mess at the last minute?
